=head1 NAME

WWW::Search::News

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an empty package.  It only exists so that CPAN users can say
"install WWW::Search::News" and they'll get what they expect.  Well,
actually I'm not sure what they expect, but they'll get something
reasonable.

I also use it to control the version number of the distribution.
